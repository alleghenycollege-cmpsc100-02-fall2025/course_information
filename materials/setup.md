## Opening the Integrated Terminal

Once VS Code is installed, you can access the terminal:

- **Windows/Linux:** `Ctrl + `` (backtick)
- **macOS:** `Cmd + `` (backtick)
- **Menu:** View â†’ Terminal

This integrated terminal will be used for all command-line operations in the following sections.

## Set up your SSH Keys

SSH keys provide secure authentication for Git operations and server access. **Use VS Code's integrated terminal for all these commands.**

## Generate the SSH Key Pair:

1. **Open VS Code's integrated terminal** (`Ctrl/Cmd + `` backtick)
2. **Run the SSH key generation command:**

```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
```

- Press Enter to accept the default file location
- Enter a passphrase when prompted (optional but recommended)

## Add the Public Key to GitHub:

1. **Copy your public key from VS Code's terminal:**
   ```bash
   # macOS/Linux:
   cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
   
   # Windows (Git Bash or PowerShell):
   cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
   ```

2. **Add to GitHub:**
   - Go to GitHub Settings â†’ SSH and GPG keys
   - Click "New SSH key"
   - Paste your public key
   - Give it a descriptive title (e.g., "My Development Machine")

3. **Test the connection from VS Code's terminal:**
   ```bash
   ssh -T git@github.com
   ```
   
   You should see a message like: "Hi username! You've successfully authenticated..."
