## Description

An introduction to the principles of computer science with an emphasis on creative expression through the medium of a programming language. Participating in hands-on activities that often require teamwork, students learn the computational structures needed to solve problems and produce computational artifacts which address these problems in real-world contexts. Students also learn how to organize and document a program's source code so that it effectively communicates with the intended users and maintainers. Additionally, the introduction includes an overview of the discipline of computer science and computational thinking. During a weekly laboratory session students use industry-grade technology to complete projects, reporting on their results through both written documents and oral presentations. Students are invited to use their own departmentally approved laptop in this course; a limited number of laptops are available for use during class and lab sessions.

Prerequisite: none.

Distribution Requirements: ME, SP.

## Learning Outcomes

### Course Learning Outcomes

1. Apply Python programming fundamentals to execute and explain computer code that implements interactive, novel solutions to a variety of computable problems.
2. Implement code consistent with industry-standard practices using professional-grade integrated development environments (IDEs), command-line tools, and version control systems.
3. Analyze and suggest revisions to existing Python language code to add functionality or repair defects.
4. Evaluate the practical and ethical implications of writing computer code and discuss the contexts, perceived effects, and impacts exerted on and by computer code as a cultural force or artifact.
5. Design, describe, and implement original projects incorporating industry-standard practices and Python language fundamentals.

### Distribution Learning Outcomes

- Modes of Expression (ME): The study of Modes of Expression explores individual and/or collective modes of expression, focusing upon the ways in which these modes create meaning and communicate thoughts, emotions, or beliefs to others. By engaging in hands-on experience, students interrogate the act of communication itself.

  Learning Outcome: Students who successfully complete this requirement will demonstrate an understanding of the production of meaning through active engagement with language, visual arts, and/or performance.

  Course learning outcomes 1, 2, 4, and 5 satisfy the ME learning outcome.

- SP: Scientific Process & Knowledge (SP). Courses involving Scientific Process & Knowledge aim to convey an understanding of what is known or can be known about the natural world; apply scientific reasoning towards the analysis and synthesis of scientific information; and create scientifically literate citizens who can engage productively in problem solving.

  Learning Outcome: Students who successfully complete this requirement will demonstrate an understanding of the nature, approaches, and domain of scientific inquiry.

  Course learning outcomes 1, 2, 3, and 5 satisfy the SP learning outcome.

## Required Materials

### Laptop 

A department‑approved laptop, with an adequate charge, is required in every class session.
The laptop requirements are available [here](https://www.cis.allegheny.edu/resources/laptops/). If you don't have a laptop that meets these specifications,
you can request to borrow one using [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdGS7Z2kMojdCMHe6fp2ovoc5XucCdL1yuynk3wPnK7MiFjDw/viewform). The department has a limited number of loaner laptops
available, so the earlier you request, the better!

### Textbook(s) 

There are no physical textbooks for this course. Any texts or articles used will be available
online or distributed in class.

GitHub and Discord are the main digital channels used in this course for communication. Students are responsible for regularly checking these platforms to ensure that important messages are not being missed.

### Grading Structure

| Category | Total Points | Number of Items | Points per Item |
|----------|-------------|----------------|----------------|
| Labs | 40 | 9 | 4.5 |
| In-Class Activities | 15 | TBD | averaged |
| Code Reviews | 20 | 9 | 2.2 |
| Midterm | 10 | 1 | 10 |
| Final Project | 15 | 1 | 15 |
| **Total** | 100 | — | — |

#### Breakdown:
##### Labs (40 points)
Weekly hands-on programming assignments where you write Python code for the Pico W. Each lab builds on previous work and develops skills toward your final IoT project. Points are based on correct functionality, code clarity, and a short reflection explaining your approach.

##### In-Class Activities (15 points)
Engaging exercises done during class, including mini coding challenges, debugging tasks, and short ethical or design discussions. These activities help you practice new concepts, collaborate with classmates, and get immediate feedback.

##### Code Review (20 points)
During lab sessions, you will verbally explain your own code or a peer's code. In addition to describing what the code does and how it works, you will answer conceptual questions related to your code to demonstrate understanding of underlying programming concepts. This helps develop both communication skills and conceptual mastery.

##### Midterm Exam (10 points)
A short assessment partway through the semester covering Python fundamentals, code analysis, and a brief ethical or design reflection. This checks your progress and understanding before the final project.

##### Final Project (15 points)
A culminating IoT system using the Pico 2 W. You will submit a working prototype, documentation, and give an oral walkthrough explaining your code and design decisions. This demonstrates your ability to integrate Python, hardware, and professional practices.

#### Gatorgrade 

Gatorgrade is a tool developed by the Allegheny College CIS department to automatically
grade assignments and give students immediate feedback.
Gatorgrade results should be considered preliminary. Project grade may include some Gatorgrade checks to
help you stay on track, but final parts of your grade for these assignments will be determined by the
professor. Even assignments that are primarily evaluated through gatorgrade are not final until otherwise
noted.
Sometimes, Gatorgrade will make a mistake. Don't hesitate to let the professor know if you suspect an
issue.

#### Final Course Grade Scale

|Grading scale|            |             |            |             |            |

### Department Policies

This course will follow [department's policies](https://www.cis.allegheny.edu/teaching/policies/), with more specified applications of the policies described below.

### Late assignments

Late assignments will not be accepted unless a token is applied at
least 24 hours before the assignment deadline. To apply a token, complete [this form](https://forms.gle/5VTNBhkM92tfXHFU9). Token can not be used for a final project.

These tokens are no‑questions‑asked. They are meant to accomodate emergency situations, illnesses, athletic events, so there
is no need to provide an excuse when applying a token.

You will have 4 tokens, and each can do one of the following:
- Extends one assignment's deadline by one week (must be applied 24 hours in advance)
OR
- Allows resubmit of one project assignment one week after receiving your grade. Resubmits can
only be used on projects where an on‑time attempt was made (an attempt means that you have
started the assignment and tried at least half the objectives).

## Artificial Intelligence in Class 

Because this is a 100 level class where practice is critical, use of artificial intelligence to generate code is not permitted unless otherwise stated in a particular assignment.
Students will be asked to supply verbal explanations of assignments to supplement their code.

## Allegheny College Policy and Awareness Statements

#### Recording Policy

Allegheny College values freedom of expression and respects individuals’ rights to privacy, the integrity of the classroom experience, faculty and College rights in instructional materials and applicable copyright law.  Both faculty and students have the reasonable expectation that class content is shared only with those who are members of the Allegheny College community; therefore, audio, video, or cell phone recording of any class at Allegheny is prohibited unless prior written permission of the instructor has been obtained and all students in the class as well as guest speakers have been informed that audio/video recording may occur. Classes may also be recorded if approved as an educational accommodation through Student Accessibility and Support services.  Recordings may not be reproduced or uploaded to publicly accessible web environments, nor may they be exchanged or distributed for commercial purposes, for compensation, or for any purpose other than individual or group study, except with the express written permission of the involved parties.  See Section 9.8 of the Faculty Handbook for the full “Recording Policy.”

#### Harassment, Discrimination, and Sexual Misconduct Reporting

Allegheny College is committed to providing a workplace and educational environment that is free from all forms of harassment, discrimination, and sexual misconduct. The College expressly prohibits discrimination and harassment on the basis of race, color, national origin, ethnicity, sex, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, gender expression, age, religion, and disability. Allegheny College prohibits sex-based harassment, sexual violence, intimate partner violence, and stalking regardless of the gender, gender identity, gender expression, or sexual orientation of the individuals involved in any education program or activity that it operates, as required by Title IX, including admission and employment.

Allegheny College adheres to all federal, state, and local civil rights laws prohibiting discrimination in employment and education. The College does not discriminate in its admissions practices, in its employment practices, or in its educational programs or activities. Allegheny College also prohibits retaliation against any person participating in good faith in any discrimination investigation or complaint process internal or external to the institution; for bringing a complaint of discrimination or harassment or for assisting someone with such a complaint.

Allegheny College is required to respond promptly and effectively, utilizing a fair, transparent, and reliable process, when they have knowledge of conduct that reasonably may constitute sex discrimination in its program, and must take steps to prevent the recurrence of discrimination and remedy its effects, the college must communicate their policies and procedures to all students, employees, and other participants in their programs and must monitor and address barriers to reporting instances of sex discrimination.

Allegheny College employees must notify their Title IX Coordinator when they have information that may reasonably rise to the level of sex discrimination, so long as the employee is not a confidential employee, as defined on page 3 of this policy. All employees must be trained upon hiring and annually thereafter on (i) the College’s obligation to address sex discrimination, (ii) the scope of conduct that constitutes sex discrimination under Title IX, including sex-based harassment, and (iii) all duties of employees upon receipt of a report of sex discrimination, including to provide the reporting individual with contact information for the Title IX Coordinator and information about how to report sex discrimination under Title IX.
Trae Yeckley, Dean for Student Life and Title IX Coordinator 814-332-3085 (direct line), titleix@allegheny.edu , Student Life Suite, Campus Center 

You can access support and resources even if you do not want to take any further action. The College respects your right to file or not file a formal complaint. The Title IX Coordinator may take action only in situations that pose a serious threat of harm to you or the community. 

NB: On January 9, 2025, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Kentucky vacated the Biden administration’s 2024 Title IX regulations. The vacatur applies nationwide, meaning the 2020 Title IX final rule and Title IX regulations are effective. Due to this ruling, Allegheny College reverted back to their Harassment, Discrimination, and Sexual Misconduct Policy and Procedures prior to August 1, 2024.

_Notice that Faculty are Responsible Employees with Mandatory Reporting Obligations_:

Unless specifically identified otherwise by policy, all faculty, staff, and administrators of Allegheny College are considered mandated reporters and are required to notify the College’s Title IX Coordinator of any incident of discrimination and harassment disclosed to them, or known to them, involving a member of the campus community. Mandated reporting helps to ensure that individuals who are experiencing or have experienced discrimination or harassment are connected to the full range of resources and options afforded to them. 
If you are in need of support or advocacy and wish to discuss such matters confidentially, you are invited to consult any of the resources listed below.
